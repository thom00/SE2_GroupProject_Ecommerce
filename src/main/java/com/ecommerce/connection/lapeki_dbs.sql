The main part that prevents UV rays from contacting human skin is the umbrella wing, sewn with fiber fabric that is effectively UV resistant. In particular, products made from fiberglass or vinyl fabrics are many choices. This is one of the materials with extremely good sun protection, waterproofing, mold resistance. In addition, high-end products are also designed with 2 layers to increase sun protection up to 99%, protecting the body in the most comprehensive way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://salt.tikicdn.com/ts/tmp/12/2e/c8/86f495e1f2ea7d3985cc2f72bfdc534e.jpg\" style=\"border-style:none; height:750px; width:750px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the umbrella fabric, the frame of the umbrella also plays an important role.

The main characters in the story are also &quot;bigger&quot;, with the stories of a very challenging career of ambitious young students. Of course, it is indispensable for emotional, dramatic and unexpected stories that make readers look away, laugh out of tears. And as in all Nguyen Nhat Anh works, kind and spirituality are still important highlights in this new book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a &quot;love detective&quot; movie, the Blue Bird flies back to lead you from surprise to curiosity, to end with an infinite joy after so many thrills to difficulty breathing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will you follow the student-employee side with tender and unique verses to, or the boss faction with entrepreneural skills? And guess what makes you so touched in life in the middle of Saigon?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s been a long time before the bustling city image in Nguyen Nhat Anh&#39;s work - the unusual appeal of the BlueBird flying back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s why the book has only one reading: one circuit from start to finish!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, each book is accompanied by 6 postcards with many paintings by artist Do Hoang Tuong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Author information</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>By Nguyen Nhat Anh</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nguy&#7877;n Nhat Anh (born May 7, 1955) is a Vietnamese writer.

        '<p>As soon as it was published in 1947, Albert Camus&#39;s novel Plague made a big impact: 161,000 copies sold out in the first two years. Since then, in the French language alone, this novel has sold over 5 million copies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And after more than 60 years after the author&#39;s death, the world has witnessed real epidemics, such as Ebola, COVID-19, No longer a fictional epidemic, problems related to humanity, how humanity faces the epidemic, a series of meaningful deep layers in the Plague suddenly become understandable , urgent in this day and age. During the plague, Oran, an ugly lifeless city on the algerian coast, had to close itself into a prison because of rats and then one person, two people, tens, hundreds of people died from the plague. Oran turned into a terrible hell, writhing in danger of extinction like many cities before in Europe, Asia, Africa. In the midst of that tragic atmosphere, despite the dangers of infection, the quiet idyllic people, stormed the battle against the Plague.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Strangers, Albert Camus stamped himself on world literature with the absurd human image. And the Plague is where he contemplates human entry as an inevitable path in the search for the meaning of life. Ideology has become symbolic, that symbol is displayed brightly in the dialogues and dialogues of Dr. Rieux. Facing two real beings: physical diseases and soul diseases, Camus&#39;s character finds his human path. And the reader can only be grateful to him for a novel that seems dry under the burden of thought but is clear by the purity of the thought itself, and the quality of love for people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>INTRODUCTION: Albert Camus (1913-1960) was one of the prominent names in French literature in the mid-and-post-World War II decades.

The story is about the poor student Raxk&ocirc;nnik because he was so lost that he killed two old sisters pawned. In the days that followed, Raxk&ocirc;nnik descended into a new tragedy, severe mental crisis. The more you try to hide your sins, the more embarrassing it becomes. The deep love, the noble sacrifice and the kind heart of the girl Rushedya and the care and love of everyone has awakened Raxk&ocirc;nnik. Ending the inner torn, he makes the decision: it is better to be physically imprisoned than to be spiritually imprisoned.<br />\r\nThe novel is one of the most tragic works of human<br />\r\nliterature. With boundless humanitarian hearts, the author has erected a bleak picture of the deadlocked fate of the russian social bottom class. The work is also a fierce denunciation of the proud 4th class, trampling on morality, dignity and talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Product prices on Tiki are inclusive of taxes under applicable law.
